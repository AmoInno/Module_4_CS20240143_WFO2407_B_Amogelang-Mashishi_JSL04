# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

## Project goal:
Use ternary operators to decide between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. Remember that while ternaries can make the code more succinct, they should be used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.

## Challenge 1
A variable is given that holds a user's preferred type of Monster Energy drink. A ternary operator was used to print whether the user prefers a "Regular" or "Sugar-free" variety. If the preference is not set, default to "Regular".

## Challenge 2
 This variable tracks the number of Monster Energy cans left in the fridge.A ternary operator is used to print "Time to restock!" if the number of Monster Energy cans in the fridge is less than 5, or "We're stocked!" if the number of Monster Energy cans in the fridge is 5 or more.

## Challenge 
In order to determine the user's workout intensity, if the current heart rate of the user is below 100 bpm, print "Boost needed!", otherwise, print "Energy levels are high!".

## Challenge 4
Monster Energy drinks are best served cold. Given the current temperature, a ternary operator is use to check the temperature suitability.If the temperature is below or equal to 5°C, print "Chilled to perfection!"  or "Needs a cooler!" if the temperature is above 5°C.

## Challenge 5
 A ternary operator is used to determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour,if it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!",otherwise, print "Better stick to water."
